I enjoyed typing today, I know that is such a random thing to like. Well not really because I do it a lot so I must enjoy it right?
Met a pretty girl today, her name was ashlee and I talked to her and gave her my number, that was a step in the right direction.
I also talked to Marisa and made some eyes at another girl, I am working at perfecting the "gay"-ze if you know what i mean.
Python actually is quite fun, I like how fun this book makes it to learn, its really a great language. So much better than 
building stupid ass websites, I dont like design at all, I prefer functionality because thats the shit. Design isnt my thing
unless we talking about the sims because design is pretty cool there. You know i keep have reoccurring dreams about forgetting about
a class in school and have like a 58% and I need to get my grade up to pass but I havent been doing any of the homework and my teacher is
my old math teacher from high school, I think his name was mr moore. Anyways its always a morning class, I honestly think I knew about it,
I just didnt ever go. I am hella stressed to during this dream because its actually a hard ass subject that I am having trouble finding out
how to bullshit because of course it some advanced ass math and I dont even know wtf they are talking about. I am just going to have to read the
whole textbook in that dream or something and lie to the teacher. That has been my plan in the dream thus far lol.
